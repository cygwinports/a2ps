ldesc: "a2ps is an Any to PostScript filter. It started as a Text to 
PostScript converter, with pretty printing features and all the expected 
features from this kind of programs. But today, it is also able to deal 
with other file types (PostScript, Texinfo, compressed, whatever...) 
provided you have the necessary tools."
